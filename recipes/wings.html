    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken wings are white meat, even though they're juicier and have a more concentrated poultry flavor, like dark meat.
      Many people think of Buffalo wings when they think of this part of the chicken, and for good reason: they're extremely 
      popular throughout the United States. The original Buffalo wings hail from Buffalo, New York, circa 1964: buttery, 
      tangy, hot sauce-coated fried wings served with blue cheese dip and celery sticks.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup yellow mustard</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>5 pounds chicken wings, cut into thirds and tips discarded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix brown sugar, mustard, and soy sauce together in a bowl. Measure 1/4 cup marinade for basting and transfer to a
          small bowl; cover and refrigerate.
      </li>
      <li>Place wings in a large resealable bag. Pour remaining marinade over wings, coating well. Seal and marinate wings at
         least 2 hours and up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Remove chicken wings from resealable bag and transfer to a baking sheet. Discard marinade.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Baste wings with reserved 1/4 cup marinade; cook, basting every 10 minutes,
         until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 more minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
