    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A grilled cheese (sometimes known as a toasted sandwich or cheese toastie) is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating
      one or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich 
      toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 slices of white bread</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
      <li>4 slices of american cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Butter goes in the pan not on the bread. To ensure golden (not burned) toastiness, the exterior of the sandwich should be slicked 
        with mayo, which has a higher smoke point than butter and possesses the combined browning power of oil and egg yolks. When mayo-slicked
        bread meets buttered pan, that’s when the magic truly begins.
      </li>

        Opting for a cheese that melts well is paramount: American is the melting-est cheese there is, but a young cheddar cheese works well too
        and brings deeper flavor. If you want to go off-script, stick to a soft or semisoft cheese. Their high moisture content means they’re 
        especially adept at turning molten.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the sandwich is in the pan, pressing down with a spatula is helpful for achieving even toasting—and for encouraging bread and cheese 
        to meld together. But don’t be overzealous; this is not a smashed cheese sandwich.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the sandwich diagonally. It’s official: Sandwiches cut this way actually taste better.
      </li>

    </ol>
